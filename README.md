Pill Dispenser (working title: Novelda)
Fab Academy2017 --beta

These files build a device that will manage pills medications for someone who needs to take them on a schedule. Ideally, this machine will dispense pills and make simple efforts to through sensors and alerts (local and internet based) to avoid too much or too little medication being taken at any time. Perhaps even with medication compliance information that could be useful for better understanding the user’s behavior. My hope was to create a valuable data stream, where there was none previously. 

To give this a more personal explanation: My grandmother recently passed of Alzheimer’s disease. My family regularly worried if she was taking her medications on schedule (as it was difficult or impossible for her to remember on her own. A device like this could manage that all for her. If everything worked perfectly, a family member could place the bottle of pills in the machine and then let it run in Grandma’s home on the kitchen counter. The machine would then dispense the pills on a schedule, but actively manage so they don’t get backlogged. An alarm would help Grandma remember when it was time to take the pills. Furthermore, an internet app could track her medication compliance, and email a family member to give Grandma a call if she seems to be getting off schedule. [This is a pie-in-the-sky dream, but the project is close to having all of those features integrated as of July 2017.] The working title given above could be a simplified name for a theoretical commercial device. It is also my own beloved grandmother’s name.

Hopefully, this could be useful to anyone who needs such a device. I am hoping to develop this project further when I have some time (I am a high school science teacher in the Cleveland, OH, USA area). If anyone is willing to employ me to work on this project, I would totally be happy to explore that option. I feel that this sort of a device is a public good, that should be free or cheap. The service (internet backend, data streams, user accounts, and online interfaces) are something that I would like to explore as a cheap paid service that could enhance the system’s utility and provide a revenue stream from this type of device.
